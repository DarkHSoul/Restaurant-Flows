
  🎯 High Priority Features

  1. Player Role & Interactivity ⭐⭐⭐

  Currently, waiters and chefs do everything automatically. Consider adding:
  - Player as Helper: Let players assist by cooking food themselves or taking orders
  - Manual cooking controls: Interact with stations to cook alongside AI chefs
  - Order taking: Option to manually take orders from customers
  - This would make the game feel more hands-on and engaging

  2. Visual Feedback & Polish ⭐⭐⭐

  - Cooking progress bars: Visual indicators on stations showing cooking progress
  - Customer speech bubbles: Better visual indicators for what customers want (I see you have emoji labels, but
  speech bubbles are hidden)
  - Sound effects: Order dings, cooking sounds, customer satisfaction sounds
  - Particle effects: Steam from cooking, satisfaction stars from happy customers

  3. Tutorial System ⭐⭐

  - New players won't know the controls or mechanics
  - Add a brief tutorial level explaining:
    - How to spawn customers (F7)
    - How the waiter/chef system works
    - How to use the shop (Tab)
    - Basic controls

  4. Save/Load System ⭐⭐

  - Save player progress between sessions
  - Save money, upgrades purchased, current level
  - This adds long-term progression

  🎮 Gameplay Enhancements

  5. More Upgrade Variety

  You have the upgrade system in EconomyManager, expand it with:
  - Kitchen upgrades: Faster ovens, multiple cooking stations
  - Staff upgrades: Faster waiters, more chefs
  - Restaurant upgrades: More tables, better decor (affects customer patience)
  - Marketing: Attract more customers per level

  6. Customer Variety & Challenges

  - VIP customers: Pay more but are more impatient
  - Groups: Multiple customers at one table with different orders
  - Special requests: Specific cooking preferences
  - Rush hours: Sudden waves of customers

  7. Fail States & Consequences

  - What happens if too many customers leave angry?
  - Reputation system consequences (I see reputation >= 50 is checked)
  - Bankruptcy mechanics (EconomyManager has this signal but needs implementation)

  🔧 Technical Improvements

  8. Performance & Bug Fixes

  The debug output error suggests there might be issues. Check for:
  - Memory leaks from spawned customers/waiters/chefs
  - Navigation errors
  - Timer issues with cooking stations

  9. UI Improvements

  - Pause menu: You have ESC bound but need a full pause UI
  - Settings menu: Volume controls, graphics options
  - Main menu: Start screen before jumping into gameplay
  - Order queue display: Show pending orders more clearly

  10. Level Design

  - Create distinct level layouts (different restaurant configurations)
  - Progressive difficulty with unique challenges per level
  - Boss levels or special events

  🎨 Immediate Quick Wins

  Based on what's already in your code:

  1. Enable speech bubbles - You have them but they're hidden (CustomerAI.gd)
  2. Add cooking progress UI - Show timers on stations
  3. Improve order board - Make it more visible and informative
  4. Add sound manager - Simple audio feedback for actions

  ---
  My recommendation: Start with #1 (Player Role) and #2 (Visual Feedback) as they'll make the biggest impact on
  gameplay feel. The game has great systems, but players need more direct involvement and visual clarity to enjoy
  it.
