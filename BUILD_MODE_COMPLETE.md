## 📊 Placement Tracking System

### How It Works
- All placed items tracked in `BuildModeManager.placed_items` dictionary
- Pre-placed items scanned on build mode entry via `scan_existing_objects()`
- Counts updated in real-time when placing/removing items
- UI shows "Placed: X/Y" for each item type
- Color-coded based on usage percentage

### Pre-Placed Items
The system automatically detects and tracks items already in the scene:
- **Oven**: 1 existing (can place 4 more)
- **Stove**: 1 existing (can place 4 more)
- **Prep Counter**: 2 existing (can place 1 more)
- **Table**: 3 existing (can place 7 more)

All pre-placed items are removable with 50% refund.

## 🔧 Zone Restrictions (Optional - Not Active)

The zone restriction system is ready but requires Area3D nodes to be added to the scene.

### How to Enable

1. **Create Kitchen Zone:**
   - Add `Area3D` node to Main3D scene
   - Add `CollisionShape3D` child with `BoxShape3D`
   - Position/size to cover kitchen area
   - Add to group: `kitchen_zone`

2. **Create Dining Zone:**
   - Add `Area3D` node to Main3D scene
   - Add `CollisionShape3D` child with `BoxShape3D`
   - Position/size to cover dining area
   - Add to group: `dining_zone`

### Allowed Items by Zone
- **Kitchen Zone**: oven, stove, prep_counter, trash_bin, serving_counter
- **Dining Zone**: table, trash_bin
- **Outside Zones**: Nothing (placement blocked)

Once zones are added, placement validation will automatically check zone restrictions.

## 🐛 Known Issues & Warnings

### Non-Critical Warnings (Safe to Ignore)
These warnings appear in debug output but don't affect functionality:
- BuildModeManager variable shadowing (line 408, 711) - intentional local scoping

- Various other code warnings listed in CLAUDE.md

### Missing Features (Optional Future Work)
- **Save/Load Integration**: Placed items don't persist between sessions yet
  - `get_placed_items_data()` and `restore_placed_items()` methods are ready
  - Needs SaveManager integration
- **Zone Area3D Nodes**: Not added to Main3D scene yet
  - Zone restriction logic is implemented and working
  - Gracefully disabled when zones don't exist
- **Premium Category**: Empty placeholder ("coming soon" message)
